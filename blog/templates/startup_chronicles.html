			<h2>Adventure 3<h2> 
			<h3>Startup School: Mission Impossible- Meet Paul Graham</h3>
			<h3>Y Combinator Dinner</h3>
			<i>Clusters of intelligence can result in mixed miracles.</i>
			<br><br>It was a surprise when I got an email from <a style="text-decoration: none;" href = "http://ycombinator.com/">Y combinator</a> telling me that I have been accepted into Startup School. 
			Did it mean we got a higher chance of being accepted into Y combinator? Maybe, but it was still a great opportunity to meet
			and network with tech superstars. On Friday night, I was invited to a special dinner in the Y combinator headquarters; not 
			all who got accepted to Startup School have been invited, only a selected few, so I felt special. 
			<br><br>The dinner was an opportunity
			to network and meet amazing people. One of those people I met was Eric Dementhon, the founder of <a style="text-decoration: none;" href = "https://www.padmapper.com/">padmapper</a>. I wanted to meet the
			Y combinator partners, especially <a style="text-decoration: none;" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Graham_(computer_programmer)">Paul Graham</a>. However, he was always surrounded by people who wanted to meet him, since he was
			the superstar. When I got the chance to meet him alone, this is what he said. With two hamburgers in his hands and chewing on one,
			he told me: "I won't be able to talk to you Marcos because I have to go with Jessica to her car." I said "ok, no problem." 
			I guessed that was his way of telling me that he was not eager to talk to me. Ouch. 
			<br><br>I met his other partner. "You look relatively 
			young to be a Y combinator partner." <a style="text-decoration: none;" href = "http://blog.harjtaggar.com/">Harj Taggar</a> explained to me how he started, sold a company, and now was working for Y combinator. 
			I told him to hold my glass (he seemed surprised with this) as I gave him my business card. Several other attempts were made to meet 
			Paul personally but he stood in the crowd talking to everyone; he was like Jesus. How could I approach him this way? Ok, snap and snap,
			I took two pictures of him in the crowd; one of them blinded him with a flash. 
			<br><br>One of the YC alumni told me, "coding is the easy part, 
			marketing is the hardest." He also told me that Paul did not like meeting a lot of people, and key information about his view on startups:
			"Paul said he is tired of hearing ideas on recommendation engines about travel or places to go." Ouch. <a style="text-decoration: none;" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Conway">Ron Conway</a>, the famous super angel, 
			showed up next. He was talking to entrepreneurs one by one, being very generous in hearing what they were building. I gave him my pitch 
			nervously, and I gave him my business card; he gave me his. If I couldn't reach Paul, at least I was able to reach his partners.

		<h3>Startup School</h3>
		<i>Most companies did not start with the intention of becoming a company, but rather they started wanting to solve a problem.</i>
		<br><br>This is what I came here for. I was lucky enough to sit behind all the superstars. I was sitting behind John Doerr, the 'Michael 
		Jordan of Venture Capitalists', and a Rice University alumni. Next to him was Marc Andreessen, founder of Netscape; Paul Buchheit
		(creator of Gmail and Friendfeed); Ashton Kutcher (actor and investor); Matt Mullenweg (Wordpress founder); Ron Conway (super angel);
		and of course, Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston (founders of Y combinator). Some of the speakers that came in later were: James Lindenbaum 
		(Heroku founder); Mark Pincus (Zynga founder); Stephen Cohen (Palantir founder); Max Levchin (Paypal founder); Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook founder),
		and Drew Houston (Dropbox founder).
		<br><br>John Doerr was taking notes on his laptop about the speakers; there is a reason why he is that successful; 
		he pays attention to detail. He was also recording the speeches with his iphone 4G, which kept on vibrating in the chair until it fell. I reached
		out to give him back his phone (should have slipped a business card there). Finally I reached out and said, "Hi John, I am from Rice, here is my 
		business card". He said "Interesting." After a short break, I got to meet John in person and pitched my idea. "We are building a recommendation 
		engine to study user tastes and preferences to recommend them similar products and services." He asked "How do you make money?", and I replied 
		"Our model is like Google ads, but more personalized, because there is so much cluttering of information and advertisement that is annoying to the user.‚Äù 
		He stood silent. Which gave me a thought: Was he impressed that we are trying to go against Google or did he think I was just bs-ing him? Probably the later. Ouch.
		<br><br>Then I met Robert Scoble, the famous Silicon Valley journalist, and started a conversation about privacy in Facebook. He thought that people will eventually get over 
		the privacy issue because they get something back by sharing information. He later emphasized that Facebook had you locked because they had your circle of friends and 
		your email address, which is key to their success, thus making Google + obsolete. Among all the speakers, the lessons were clear: try out things and fail fast (Mark Zuckerberg);
		build a legacy (Ashton Kutcher); solve a problem instead of focusing on the idea (Paul Graham); be careful on choosing partners (Max Levchin); as a defining entrepreneur, 
		understand your customer really well (Ron Conway); surround yourself with talent- "You are the average of your 5 closest friends" (Drew Houston). 
		<br><br>In the middle of Paul Graham's speech, which simulated the office hours at Y combinator, an awkward moment (if funny) happened. The microphone of one of the applicants talking to Paul was not loud enough and 
		people struggled to hear her speak. Paul Graham instructed her: "You have to put it into your mouth." A wave of laughter went through the cloud. I shook my head and said out loud
		"You guys are so dirty minded". John Doerr did not laugh. A blond tall women showed up, and sat in the front with Paul, Mark, and Jessica. She seemed pretty familiar. Ron Conway
		later finished his speech honoring Steve Jobs as the most 'defining entrepreneur'. I asked two people beside me if the blond women was Laurene Jobs, Steve Job's wife. They said 
		probably not, but then one of them confirmed to me about her. That was amazing. 
		<br><br>Among with other people who showed up was also Troy Carter, the manager of Lady Gaga. Then I 
		figured out why Troy Carter and Ashton Kutcher were there. The internet (especially social media) is having so much influence on people that celebrities needed to learn about 
		technology to influence their fans. It just made sense. As a final note, I met the only graduate student of Sebastian Thrun (creator of Google Car). Among all the people whom I met,
		I don't know how many were secretly geniuses hiding in their 'common people' carcasses. This is why networking is so important. Meanwhile, Paul was still surrounded by superstars 
		and I was intimidated to meet him. I later got an opportunity when he was last to leave the auditorium, but one of his secretaries told me "You can just wait over there." 
		And that is how I missed the last opportunity. I went home feeling miserable for not meeting him, I felt disappointed at myself for letting down my co-founder for not being able to meet Paul.
		My only opportunity to pitch to him was gone.
