			<h2>Beginnings</h2>
			You have heard the phrase: "We are what we eat". Can the same be said with "we are what we read", or more specifically, "we are what we do."? 
			<br><br>The idea started in a restaurant when the founders found it hard to order food, confronted with overwhelming choices and a lack of quality 
			information. This fueled a bigger question: how do we make the right choices? People resort to high quality information from experts when 
			making decisions. In the internet era, overwhelming information often creates noise and blocks the user's ability to make the right choices. 
			<br><br>The team shared a common frustration with finding relevant and quality information, but once that information was found, they also wanted 
			to save and retrieve it quickly and easily. Dediced was created to solve this problem. More than a bookmarking platform, Dediced includes 
			a ranking algorithm to help categorize and organize data based on the interest and expertise of each user. With time, the user will find 
			other hidden interests and talents, ultimately discovering what they love doing.<b> What if everyone can develop their full potential by 
			choosing to do what they love? Will this world function more efficiently and happily?</b> This is the premise behind Dediced.

			Marcos is in charge of operations, marketing, and business development.

			<br><br>Vic created ta2, billid, and co-founded Dediced. He graduated from Rice University in 2011 
			with Bachelors in Electrical Engineering and Physics. He believes that everyone can bring a 
			huge impact to the world with little decisions they make everyday, starting with smarter 
			information and sustainable intelligence.
			<br><br><br>The co-founders have known each other since 2009 and are close friends. 
			They met as college roommates, and later took an iPhone programming class together,
			which served as an inspiration for Dediced.
